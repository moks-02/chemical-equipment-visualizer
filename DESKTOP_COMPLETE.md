5. **Check History**: Switch to History tab to see all uploads
6. **Download PDF**: Click "📥 Download PDF" to get report

## Current Status

✅ **Phase 4 - Desktop Frontend**: COMPLETE
- Login/Signup window
- Main application window
- Dashboard with visualizations
- History management
- PDF download
- Dark theme matching web frontend

## Next Steps (Remaining Phases)

- **Phase 5**: Testing and Quality Assurance
- **Phase 6**: Documentation
- **Phase 7**: Deployment Preparation
- **Phase 8**: Final Deliverables

## Architecture

```
Desktop App (PyQt5)
    ↓
HTTP Requests (requests library)
    ↓
Django Backend API (port 8000)
    ↓
SQLite Database
```

    ├── dashboard_tab.py  # Dashboard with charts
    └── history_tab.py    # Upload history
```

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: PyQt5 5.15.10
- **Charts**: matplotlib 3.8+
- **HTTP**: requests 2.31+
- **Data**: pandas 2.1+
- **Backend**: Django REST API

## Notes

- Desktop app connects to `http://localhost:8000/api`
- Uses same authentication tokens as web frontend
- Charts match web frontend styling (red accent #ef4444)
- PDF reports generated by backend with same 3 charts

## Troubleshooting

If the app doesn't start:
1. Ensure PyQt5 is installed: `pip install PyQt5`
2. Check backend is running on port 8000
3. Verify Python version is 3.8+

The desktop application is fully functional and ready for testing!
